Thesis research question
How effective is applying evolutionary algorithms and the communication closure 
to the ordering of messages in blockchain-based consensus algorithms at uncovering concurrency and consistency bugs?

Explain:
- blockchain, what is it -> ripple
- Consensus, explain ripple's
- Communication closure, explain messages and ordering
- Evolutionary algorithms, explain general evolutionary algorithm and application to messages

Intoduction

Blockchain -> General technology, implication and applications

Ripple consensus -> How does it work and why is it interesting

Communication Closure -> Reducing state-space

Evolutionary algorithms -> Which ones am I gonna use and why, black-box or goal oriented

Representation of test case -> Abstract away from exact message, encode order.

Fitness function? -> Guide the EA

How to determine a bug has been found? -> Invariant checking, what are concurrency and consistency bugs?

Repoducability -> How to reproduce a found bug in the face of non-determinism

Experiment -> setup and results

Conclusion and discussion -> Is it effective? future research?
