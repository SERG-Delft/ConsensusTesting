Progress update

- Online vs offline scheduling
Do online scheduling

- Buffer vs direct scheduling
No need for buffer, just apply delay as soon as messages come in. Requires correct identification/encoding before test case.

- Exact delay vs only reordering
Exact delay is better for catching reordering internal events as well. Delays are building blocks for reordering messages as well.

- Problem encoding
See documents/MessageDelayEncoding in the repo. A message delay is identified by the sender, receiver and type of message.
An individual consists of a delay for all combinations of sender, receiver and type.

What is my test case?
Two or three rounds would be good. Schedule transactions at some delay in these rounds as a test harness.

Fitness function
Will start with simple function, time till consensus. Possibly extend with # of rounds / # of messages.
Later instrument code to target one or multiple branches of interest.

TaxDC terminology
Identified certain types of bugs and how to catch them.
Validators decide on different transactions. Validation will most likely fail and consensus will retry?
Catch this by looking at validation messages.
One transaction applied twice. Double spend problem. If in supermajority of the validators, it will pass validation. Major bug.
Check for this by inspecting validated ledgers and comparing to transactions submitted.

Communication closure
Big enough delay is similar to dropping a message. Transaction dissemination messages don't carry a round number.
Will most likely not be complete in enumeration. Leave for now, might add later.
