# Meeting Notes 11-05-2021

Add Jepsen to papers and listen to some talks of the author

Exploratory testing: Not too important \
Demi: Tests consensus protocols so look at the bugs they find, same goes for taxDC \
FlyMC: Ignore for now, is enumeration not search, only state-reduction \
TOR: Ignore \
Amazon: Verifies specification, not implementation. Different realm, ignore \
Blockchain testing: Skip smart contracts, focus on the underlying system/ledger. \
CSF: Investigate capabilities of consensus simulation framework in termes of network partition, network ordering, synchrony, relevance to the actual protocol \
Mutation adequacy: Interesting how they mutate the test data. Keep in mind they have a different goal. \
General search-based: Read in detail. \
Random testing: Skip the mathematical detail. Overview section about partition tolerance effects. Test goals, coverage notions.

Try to find similarities and differences to our approach while reading the papers.
Keep searching for more papers, particularly in search-based testing distributed systems area.

Change to bi-weekly meetings.
