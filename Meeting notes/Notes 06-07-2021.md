Perhaps use black-box methods. For example, look at diversity.

One idea for distance ingredient:
See divergence of state in different bugs.

Determine wether to go goal-oriented or black-box method.

Look at the bugs and TAXDC paper and look at which bugs are good for goal-oriented approach.

Also determine distance between solutions (test-case).
Also determine distance between output and how it got there.

Keep a journal of decision made by me.
