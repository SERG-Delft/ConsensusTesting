# Meeting Notes 04-05-2021
Progress: Trying to run Ripple in a private network. Still working on it
Try to connect to main net first, log messages. After, run on private network.

Two different types of papers. 
1. search-based testing (what type of problems are these applied to). High-level evolutionary algorithms
	We expect concurrency errors and consistency errors. Find papers that find these bugs. Check citation numbers and author research lines for compatibility of papers.
2. Distributed systems testing approaches. (particularly blockchain testing)

Collect the papers in one place, read abstracts and next meeting determine appropriate papers to read in more detail
